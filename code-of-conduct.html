            <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
            <p>Arya Hackathon 2025 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any location at venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund at the discretion of the hackathon organizers.</p>

            <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
            <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
            
            <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
            
            <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
            
            <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the hackathon with no refund.</p>
            
            <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of hackathon staff immediately. Hackathon staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.</p>
